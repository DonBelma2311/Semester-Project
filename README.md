information about products, including their quantity, price, and other details. The 
technologies used for this project include C++ programming language, and 
database management systems such as MySQL. Additionally, techniques such as 
Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Structured Query Language (SQL) will 
be used to create an efficient and robust inventory system.
